# Lark
repo for our band

Go to branch version0 for initial version. (I dont know why it is not in branch-master)

Details see each folder. Here is a quick guide to add a new page:

a) go to app.json under root. find the key "tabBar".
b) add new element into the list of "tabBar". Mimicking the current pages will be a quick start, specifying the page location. Usually I use "pages/your_new_page/your_new_page".
c) go to the folder "pages/your_new_page/your_new_page" (create one if not exists), you will find 4 files. Details about how to set up that four files can be found in README under branch-version0.

Enjoy!
